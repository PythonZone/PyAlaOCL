Modelio Integration
===================

PyAlaOCL expressions can be used in the jython interpreter of the modelio_ open source environment, making it possible to evaluate OCL expressions on UML or BPMN models.

Rationales
----------
While modelio_ open source tool is an excellent tool it does not currently provide OCL support. Its scripting environment based on jython is however one of its best features.
